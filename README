This is a Proof of Concept to show how to generate actual network configuration from an Archimate model.

See the documentation of the diagram to understand what is missing from the modeling perspective.

The xslts are intended to run either standalone or using the styledhtml export module.
Both xslts are fine with a "targetdir" parameter, and node-linux acually uses it.

network.xslt generates a simplified network model with nodes, interfaces and networks.
node-linux.xslt generates an /etc/default/interfaces file.

As it is just a PoC, there is no sanity checks whatsoever, no other files are generated, and no generator for other OSs.
Even the netmask table knows only about /1 and /24 :)

You can work from here however.
